Copy the OMNeT++ archive to the directory where you want to install it and 
extract it. Then enter the following commands:

	$ ./configure
	$ make

More details about the installation process can be found in 
http://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf.

2. Import INET 2.1.0. Download INET 2.1.0

a new project into your workspace (File > Import > General > Existing project 
into Workspace) and select the option 'Select archive ﬁle'.

3. Copy and override the file ManetRoutingBase.cc from NETA framework located

(Project > Properties > Project References). Also, the 'MANET Routing' project 
feature must be selected (Project > Properties > OMNET++ > Project Features)
