<p><center><h1>NETwork Attacks Framework for OMNeT++</h1></center>
<center>release 0.0.1</center></p>
<p><b> NETwork Attacks (NETA)</b> is a framework devised to simulate attacks in heterogeneous networks using OMNeT++. 
There exists a huge amount of research in network security and, with this framework, we pretend to give an 
useful tool to researcher that are working on it. This tool could make easy to demonstrate the eï¬€ectiveness 
of defence (detection or response) techniques against manet attacks or to compare the capabilities of different 
defence techniques among many other applications. NETA is a <a href="http://inet.omnetpp.org/" target="_blank">INET 2.1.0</a> based framework. INET provides realistic 
implementations of structures and protocols on each protocol layers, especially in the higher ones: network, 
transport and application layers. For example, INET develops Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) routing protocols as AODV, DSR, OLSR, etc., 
and several TCP implementations as well as several applications. Thanks to the versatile and extensible schema of NETA, 
a huge amount attacks could be implemented in each protocol layer.</p>
<p>NETA provides a useful tool for the research community for netowrk security threats concerns. NETA tries 
to be a reference base tool for the network attacks simulation and implementation. 
Is delivered under GPL license for free use of the research community, thus growing with the contributions 
of this community.</p>
<p>NETA makes the attack use and design easier!</p>
