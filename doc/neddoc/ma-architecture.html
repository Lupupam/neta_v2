<h2>NETA framework architecture</h2>
<p>The NETA framework uses the same idea as OMNeT++, i.e., modules that communicate by message passing.</p>
<p>The general idea of the present framework is to develop new nodes which can strike attacks.
	In order to do this, the implemented attacks are managed in what we called attack controllers.
	These controllers affect to one or more modules of INET framework through control
	messages sending parameters of the developed attacks. Therefore, these modules should be
	conveniently modiﬁed to obey the orders of the control messages. These modiﬁed modules
	are named hacked modules. The creation of an attacker can be summarized as: <i> (i)</i>  add to
	the associated <code>.ned</code>  ﬁle the controllers related with the attacks to be executed, <i> (ii)</i> create the
	associate control messages and, <i> (iii)</i> substitute the modules these attack controllers need to use
	by the correspondent hacked modules.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1 we can see the comparison between a normal node and an attacker node. The
	normal node is composed of simple and compound modules which communicate between them.
	The attacker node is composed of the same number of modules and its communications and the
	attack controller modules. However, some modules have been substituted by the correspondent
	hacked modules to allow the execution of the attacks trigger by the included attack controllers.</p>

<p>In Fig. 2 we present an example of the module that compose a normal node <code> (AdhocHost)</code>  and
	its correspondent attacker node <code>(MA_AdhocHost)</code> .</p>

<p><h3>Folder structure</h3> </p>
<p>The folders of this framework has a speciﬁc structure we describe in the following (we only
	mention the speciﬁc folders of this framework excluding the folders in common with OMNeT++):</p>
<p><ul>
 	<li><b>src:</b> 
      <ul>
      	<li>attacks : In this folder are located the attack controllers and the control messages used by these
								controllers to communicate with the associated hacked modules.
			</li> 
        	<li>hackedmodules : Here it can be found all the modiﬁed modules to be able of triggering the implemented
									attacks by this release, i.e., the hacked modules.
			</li>
			<li>nodes : In this folder it can be found all the new hosts that are a slight modiﬁcation of
							the existent ones in INET framework. They have inside of them the
							correspondent hacked modules.
			</li>
      </ul>
		</li>
 	<li><b>simulations:</b>
			Here the simulations to demonstrate the use of the implemented attacks by this framework
			are present.
		</li>
	</ul></p>
